<h1>Fight Night, Combat Sport Event Manager for Clubs and Societies </h1>
<h4> Project in which I hope to learn about the ASP.Net Core ecosystem for backend development, as well as coding principles and design patterns</h4>
<br>

<h2> Tech Stack </h2>
<h3>Front-End <h5>(Acceptable BareBones UI, Main concerns are the back end functionalities)</h5> </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Typescript </li>
  <li> React </li>
  <li> Tailwind CSS </li>
  <li> Shadcn UI Components </li>
</ul>

<h3>Back-End</h3>
<ul>
  <li> C# </li>
  <li> ASP.NET Core 8.0 </li>
</ul>

Documentation and code samples coming Up Soon, will talk about <br>
- design patterns used and SOLID principles followed
- Account Controller (credential &OAuth login) (theres actually alot of cool stuff in this controller, in my humble opinion)
- Message Controller and Chat Hub (Caching Connected Users, seperating concerns between contollers and hubs)
- Use of Entity Core Framework, some cool queries :D

I would say backend is finsihed for presentability (apart for documentation and some tests)
